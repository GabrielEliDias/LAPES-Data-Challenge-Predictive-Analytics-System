## Pipeline Overview

### 1. Data Ingestion and ELT
- Automated pipeline using Docker and GitHub Actions
- Raw data stored in Bronze, transformations handled via SQL triggers
- Access policies applied at each layer

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Descriptive statistics, correlation matrices, missing value analysis
- Anomaly detection and data profiling

### 3. Machine Learning
- Supervised learning: logistic regression, random forests, XGBoost
- Cross-validation and metric tracking (accuracy, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC)

### 4. Deep Learning
- Neural networks for fraud detection (imbalanced classification)
- Training with class balancing techniques (e.g., SMOTE)
- Model evaluation with robust metrics

### 5. Visualization and Reporting
- Static plots with matplotlib/seaborn
- Interactive dashboards with Streamlit and Plotly
